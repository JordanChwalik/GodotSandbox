This was a project to learn how to use the Godot game engine.
It was performed by following a tutorial on the Godot website which
you can find [here] (https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html).

Prior to starting the project I had experimented with Unity in the past
and I had done this same project months previous. This particular version
was done to refresh my knowledge of the engine in preparation to making
my first unique game currently under the pseudonym [Tanuki Project](https://github.com/JordanChwalik/TanukiProject).

Because this was a refresher, I opted not to do anything optional like sound
effects because the sound design elements of the main project this was helping
me prepare for are much further down the road. A new project will be created
later to experiment with sound effects.
