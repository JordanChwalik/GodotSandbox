# GodotSandbox
A place to put godot files while I am experimenting with new features.

While I am working with Godot I often encounter problems that I want to experiment with different solutions for but
don't want to risk modifying the current build of whatever project prompted the need to experiment. This repository
will be a collection of small tests that I will be working with to create my own library of solutions to problems I've
encountered.

With each project I plan to include a README to detail what the original problem was, what solutions I tried, and what
I wound up doing to resolve the problem. Because it is likely that my descriptions will not always include repeated
details, I will keep a chronological list of the projects added to this repository. This way, anyone who wishes to
know why certain project descriptions look more like a description of a unit test (the ideal for the projects in this
repository) and others have in depth descriptions.
